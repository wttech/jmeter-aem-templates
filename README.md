# Introduction
AEM JMeter template is a predefined Test Plan template, ready to use. Template accelerates performance tests implementation for web applications with JMeter tool and introduces set of good practices.

# Main features
* Parametrization - re-used, preconfigured User Variables,
* Modularization using Module Controllers,
* Tuned for Adobe AEM - preconfigured thread that activates page on author (to replicate page via author-publish-dispatcher path). Thread also presents how to authenticate to AEM Author instance and reuse CSRF token (works with AEM 6.5),
* Preconfigured loggers - preconfigured Simple Data Writers for .csv, .xml and Influx database (for Live monitoring).
* Other features:
    * Think times with parametrized Gaussian Random Timer,
    * Test Profiles with User Defined Variables for different test environments,
    * HTTP Request configured for download embedded resources, parallel download and filtering out calls to 3rd parties domains,
    * Exemplary HTTP Requests (GET, POST) and Config Elements (Transaction and Throughput Controllers),
	* User agents variability - in some cases it is important to test with different user agents (CDN caching algorithms that relay on user agent, mobile channels),

# Prerequisites
* JMeter 5.1.1 (http://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi)
* Plug-in Manager (https://jmeter-plugins.org/wiki/PluginsManager/)
* Install plug-ins:
  * 3 Basic Graphs,
  * 5 Additional Graphs,
  * Distribution/Percentile Graphs,

# Installing template  
Copy .xml snippet from "templates-snippet.xml" and  paste into JMeter templates file "\bin\templates\templates.xml". Remember to preserve correct XML syntax.

# All Features
* Test Plan element - with ${project} variable to be changed.
* "Domains" User Defined Variables - Server related variables for each environment. Enable or disable appropriate one (e.g.: Domains STAGING to test staging).
* "Variables" User Defined Variables - test profiles for LOAD, SOAK, STRESS tests with Thread and Time related variables. Enable or disable appropriate one. Data is exemplary and to be change in a project.
* "Main Tread" Group:
    * ${thread} and ${rampup} variables used for Forever run.
    * HTTP Request Defaults element
        * with ${domain} and ${protocol} variables used
        * Embedded Resources are downloaded
        * Parallel download of embedded resources = 6 (simulate browser behaviour)
        * Filtering out 3rd party domains - Tab Advanced ".*${domain}.*" regular expression. No analitycs will be send.
    * Cookie Manager
        * Clears cookie each iteration
	* CSV Config
		* reads data from CSV file and passes to Header Manager (user-agent variable)
    * Header Manager
        * adds Host header with ${domain} variable
    * Gaussian Random Timer
        * adds Think Time before EVERY sample
        * uses ${think-time-deviation} and ${think-time-constant} variables
    * Throughput Controller
        * demonstrates hot to split users in percentage manner e.g.: New users vs Returning users
		* Demonstrates usage of Module Controllers (reusable blocks of scripts)
        * HTTP Cache manager - simulating caching assets in browser
        * HTTP request Sampler
            * Response Assertion
        * Transaction Controller
            * Demonstrates how to embed multiple samples into one Transaction.
            * "Log in" POST request
* Modules Thread:
	* implementation of modules.
	* "Activate Page EXAMPLE" Thread group
		* Activates content from ${content-demo} variable using AEM /libs/replication/treeactivation.html servlet
		* Hits Author to push correct flow of invalidation: Author->Publish->Dispatcher
* Set of useful graphs that can be used to import .csv result file and analyze test results.
* Simple Data Writer CSV
    * Configured to write samples only to .csv file
* Simple Data Writer XML
    * Configured to write samples and sub samples to xml file. Use this one if you want to know Server Hits not only Transactions per second.
* Backend Listener for Live monitoring
    * Preconfigured to push summary only data to localhost Influx database.
    * uses ${project} variable to add prefix for database measurements.
